# Welcome to 2002

## What Happened to the Website?
My website has always been a business card site: nickname, avatar, and links to social networks. Honestly, I didn’t need anything more. But over the past year, either I lost my mind, or my dissatisfaction with every little detail spilled over onto the website. As a result, any minor changes I made in the online space immediately made their way to the site. "Oh! A new avatar on CivitAi! I need to add it to the site right now!" — that’s pretty much how it happened.

## How I Tried to Stop Hiding Behind Avatars
A month ago, I decided to create a logo to proudly display on the site and stop changing avatars every two weeks. Unfortunately, despite having designed logos for many of my past projects, I couldn’t create one for myself. Every idea I had ended up looking like some illegitimate offspring of the Moscow Metro logo.

So, I put the idea of creating a logo on hold. I decided to redesign the site, removing all possible images and leaving only my nickname and links.
Unfortunately, this version of the site didn’t last long. After a couple of weeks, only my nickname remained, and I went back to brainstorming.

## Another Attempt at Creating a Logo
While aimlessly scrolling through a half-dead YouTube, I stumbled upon a video by a Moscow fan of the Apple ecosystem. He was talking about the iPod Classic and changes to his channel. Specifically, he mentioned a new logo designed for him by a designer who wished to remain anonymous, as he was planning to enter the international market. Looking at that logo, I decided, just for fun, to create something similar for myself. Since my nickname doesn’t fit well into a logo, I decided to use the first letters of the pseudonym I use on all sites where a first and last name are required. However, even with these letters, the logo turned out, to put it mildly, not great. Unfortunately, I can’t show it to you because I didn’t save it.

## Website Redesign and the Reasons Behind It
While watching the video by the Moscow Apple fan about the iPod Classic, in which he explained that people abroad were massively buying these devices for one reason — "Oh, those recommendations in music services! They always push something new! But I just want to listen to my favorite band, '25 Skibidi Toilets,' on repeat!" (the wording wasn’t exactly like this, but that was the general idea) — I came to the conclusion that people simply want to escape reality and return to a time when the grass was greener and the dollar was cheaper. If this weren’t the case, there wouldn’t be projects like OpenVK, YouTube Redux, the old VK design, and other nostalgia-focused platforms. Since I experienced that era of the internet, I wanted to bring back a piece of it — at least on my own site. As a result, you’re reading this message on a site designed in the style of the 2000s.

## What’s Next?
Honestly, I’m not sure what I’ll post here. Maybe I’ll share some funny stuff. But one thing is certain: I’m not planning to redesign the site again for at least a year.
