# Announcement of the Russian Localization for Mad Father on Nintendo Switch

## "One small step for man, one giant leap for mankind."
6,131 modified files. It may seem like a trifle considering the number of files on the internet. But all these files are vital parts of the upcoming Russian localization for Mad Father.

## Backstory
Attempts to translate the Switch version began as far back as 2024, but unfortunately, due to bugs and a lack of interest from the Switch community, the translation project was shut down after just one day.

On January 2, 2025, a torrent for Mad Father for Nintendo Switch appeared on RuTracker.org. This suggests that interest in translating the game might rise. Right?

Well, I couldn’t find any announcements from other translators. That means the upcoming release of this translation will be yet another victory for Shunter (a joke only 5–10 people will understand).

## So, what's up with the translation?
The translation will be based on the work of RedKittens.
As of January 12, 2025, a test build 1201 has already been compiled.

The release date has not been announced yet.

## Why wasn't the translation done earlier?
The main reason is probably the engine.
The PC version runs on WOLF RPG Editor, which doesn’t support Nintendo Switch. But then how does the game work if the script files for the Switch version are the same as in the PC version? The Switch version works through Unity, using files from WOLF RPG Editor.

Additionally, the Game.dat file is locked to one language (in the case of the English localization, it's locked to English, which is a single-byte language). Since the language changes only when the console's language changes, to make the Game.dat locked to English recognize Russian text, it’s necessary to load it into WOLF RPG Editor and change the game’s language to Japanese.

That’s basically it!
