# Release of the Mad Father Russian Localization for Nintendo Switch  

## A Post About the Release a Day Later  
On January 28, 2025, the porting of the Mad Father Russian localization for Nintendo Switch was completed. The entire process took 16 days (unfortunately, I kept postponing testing for too long).  

After finishing the work, I created a [repository on GitHub](https://github.com/qnezor/madfather-nx-rus) and published a [post in the Russian localization thread on 4PDA](https://4pda.to/forum/index.php?showtopic=937297&view=findpost&p=134920649). Over 4 hours later, the number of downloads on 4PDA was 2 (one of which was mine). However, I understood that *Mad Father* is a niche game in the Russian community, and its translation was unlikely to interest many people—so even a single download was already a success.  

## Morning Brings Wisdom  
The next day, on January 29, I received a notification from 4PDA: my reputation was increased, and the localization was added to the thread’s header. Victory!

But there's one "but." The link in the header doesn’t lead to my post but instead to a magnet link for torrent clients. The files available through this link are formatted in the style of RuTracker distributions.

There’s no way they updated the RuTracker distribution just to add the translation...

They could.  

As a result, the translation is now available on two major platforms.  

## Acknowledgments  
Thanks to the Switch scene for making this project possible, to sen and Playism for the game (but sen deserves to have their hands torn off because the bugs in a game that was last updated in 2021 are disgraceful), to RedKittens for translating the PC version, and to Brikachu and omg_gods for distributing the port.  

And of course, thanks to you, dear readers.
